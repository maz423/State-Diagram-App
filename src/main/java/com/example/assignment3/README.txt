I have implemented all 4 parts of the assignment, and they seem to be working almost fine, there are some implementation decisions i made because of lack of details of some tricky cases in the Assignment.
Few implementation decisions i made:

The self link info box does not move when you select and drag it. it only moves when the node it is associated with is dragged.
The self link is always created on the right side of the node.

canvas resizing works but is capped at 1600*1600. after this canvas does not grow.
